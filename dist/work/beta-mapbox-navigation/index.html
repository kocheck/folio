    <h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Roadtrippers developed an integrated navigation system targeting day-trippers and full-time RV travelers who prefer a single-app solution for their travel planning needs. The project was built on the Mapbox Navigation SDK and focused on completing the road trip flow within the Roadtrippers ecosystem. This initiative later expanded to include carplay integration with RV-safe routing.</p>
<h2>Challenge</h2>
<p>The primary challenges included:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hardware limitations of older supported devices and software versions</li>
<li>Working within Mapbox Navigation SDK constraints</li>
<li>User attrition due to external app handoffs, which affected Plus subscription conversions</li>
<li>Balancing custom UI development with resource efficiency</li>
<li>Creating a seamless experience that wouldn&#39;t require users to leave the platform</li>
</ul>
<h2>Solution</h2>
<p>The team implemented a comprehensive approach:</p>
<ul>
<li>Leveraged Mapbox Navigation SDK with strategic customizations</li>
<li>Developed high-fidelity prototypes to ensure compatibility with SDK</li>
<li>Created dark mode variants for enhanced nighttime navigation</li>
<li>Utilized existing pin dropper functionality</li>
<li>Implemented a thorough design process including:<ul>
<li>Problem definition and success metrics</li>
<li>Extensive research and analysis</li>
<li>Solution generation and validation</li>
<li>Three-phase testing strategy (UI prototypes, internal builds, beta testing)</li>
<li>Early engineering collaboration</li>
<li>Standardized design communication across teams</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Impact</h2>
<p>The project delivered several key benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>Kept users within the Roadtrippers ecosystem for longer periods</li>
<li>Increased potential for Roadtrippers Plus conversions</li>
<li>Created foundation for future enhancements (including carplay integration)</li>
<li>Improved user experience by eliminating the need for multiple apps</li>
<li>Strengthened cross-functional collaboration between teams</li>
<li>Established a robust testing and validation process for future features</li>
</ul>
<h2>Explorations</h2>
<p>A few explorations that didn&#39;t make it to production.</p>
