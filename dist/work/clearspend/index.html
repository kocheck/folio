    <h2>Overview</h2>
<p>ClearSpend is a specialized spend control and expense management platform designed for small businesses. The project evolved from concept to full launch between 2021-2022, with initial proof of concept completed by Christmas 2021 and official launch in February 2022. As the lead designer, I worked closely with multiple teams including marketing, branding, mobile product, and leadership while establishing a comprehensive design system.</p>
<h2>Challenge</h2>
<p>The primary challenges included:</p>
<ul>

<li>Aggressive timeline requirements (5 months to soft launch, 3 months to hard launch)</li>
<li>Need to create a system that required minimal human intervention</li>
<li>Complex data structure requirements for budget management</li>
<li>Accessibility issues with brand colors</li>
<li>Balancing information density with usability</li>
<li>Creating scalable solutions for future multi-account functionality</li>
</ul>
<h2>Solution</h2>
