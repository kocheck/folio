    <h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Pin Dropper was developed to enhance Roadtrippers&#39; mapping functionality by allowing users to manually place custom waypoints on the map. The project targeted road warriors and full-time RV travelers who were familiar with mainstream mapping applications. This feature served as both a quick way to add arbitrary points to trips and laid the groundwork for future platform developments.</p>
<h2>Challenge</h2>
<p>The primary challenges included:</p>
<ul>
<li>Users could only add locations by address or choosing from existing database entries</li>
<li>Missing core functionality available in competitor platforms</li>
<li>Need to maintain consistent experience across different devices and platforms</li>
<li>Complex tablet-specific UI/UX considerations</li>
<li>API and device performance constraints</li>
<li>Lack of a unified design system across platforms</li>
</ul>
<h2>Solution</h2>
<p>The team implemented a comprehensive solution that included:</p>
<ol>
<li>Development of reusable UI components that would support future features</li>
<li>Platform-specific adjustments while maintaining consistent user experience</li>
<li>Careful consideration of tablet-specific behaviors through prototype testing</li>
<li>Implementation of performance optimizations for older mobile devices</li>
<li>Structured design process including:<ul>
<li>Problem definition and success metrics</li>
<li>Extensive research and analysis</li>
<li>Solution generation and validation</li>
<li>Prototype testing</li>
<li>Cross-functional collaboration with engineering teams</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The testing process was conducted in three phases:</p>
<ul>
<li>UI prototype user testing</li>
<li>Internal build testing</li>
<li>Opt-in beta testing</li>
</ul>
<h2>Impact</h2>
<p>The project delivered significant results:</p>
<ul>
<li>Grew to 2 million unique monthly users</li>
<li>Maintained 4.7 app store rating</li>
<li>Reduced support requests related to custom location additions</li>
<li>Increased new trip creation rates</li>
<li>Created foundation for future feature developments (particularly beneficial for 2020 feature releases)</li>
<li>Improved cross-platform consistency while maintaining platform-specific optimizations</li>
<li>Enhanced user satisfaction by addressing a frequently requested feature</li>
</ul>
