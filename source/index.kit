        <h2>I am me, An assorted hat of various interests ranging from archeology, anthropology, psychology, and whatever bucket actually reading the Silmarillion would put me in.</h2>
        <p>
          Taking things apart to understand "why" is just as important to me as building and creating something myself, allowing me to understand the how.
        </p>
        <p>
          Having pride in my work is striving for craft while
          acknowledging there is always room for improvement. I am not
          the best designer, nerd, or human...but I am, and work hard
          to be better than I was the day before.
        </p>
        <p>
          I believe that form follows function, and purpose enables
          refinement.
