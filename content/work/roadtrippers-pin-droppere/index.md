# Project Details
challenge: "Users had no way to add custom waypoints on the map without having a specific address, limiting trip planning flexibility and accuracy."
solution: "Developed a 'Pin Dropper' feature allowing users to manually place custom waypoints on the map, with consistent behavior across platforms and devices."
impact: "Achieved 2 million unique monthly users while maintaining a 4.7 app store rating. Reduced support requests and increased new trip creation rates."

## Overview

Pin Dropper was developed to enhance Roadtrippers' mapping functionality by allowing users to manually place custom waypoints on the map. The project targeted road warriors and full-time RV travelers who were familiar with mainstream mapping applications. This feature served as both a quick way to add arbitrary points to trips and laid the groundwork for future platform developments.

## Challenge

The primary challenges included:
- Users could only add locations by address or choosing from existing database entries
- Missing core functionality available in competitor platforms
- Need to maintain consistent experience across different devices and platforms
- Complex tablet-specific UI/UX considerations
- API and device performance constraints
- Lack of a unified design system across platforms

## Solution

The team implemented a comprehensive solution that included:
1. Development of reusable UI components that would support future features
2. Platform-specific adjustments while maintaining consistent user experience
3. Careful consideration of tablet-specific behaviors through prototype testing
4. Implementation of performance optimizations for older mobile devices
5. Structured design process including:
   - Problem definition and success metrics
   - Extensive research and analysis
   - Solution generation and validation
   - Prototype testing
   - Cross-functional collaboration with engineering teams

The testing process was conducted in three phases:
- UI prototype user testing
- Internal build testing
- Opt-in beta testing


## Impact

The project delivered significant results:
- Grew to 2 million unique monthly users
- Maintained 4.7 app store rating
- Reduced support requests related to custom location additions
- Increased new trip creation rates
- Created foundation for future feature developments (particularly beneficial for 2020 feature releases)
- Improved cross-platform consistency while maintaining platform-specific optimizations
- Enhanced user satisfaction by addressing a frequently requested feature
