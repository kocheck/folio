## Overview

Project Teton was a comprehensive redesign of the Roadtrippers trip planner platform, focusing on enhancing the experience for power usersâ€”those who plan long, detailed road trips. As the lead designer, I collaborated with the Director of Product, two PMs, and another Sr. Designer to transform the platform's core functionality and visual system. The project's scope included creating a modular trip planner, improving search and filter capabilities, and developing a future-proof color system that would serve as the foundation for the Bonfire Design System.

## Challenge

The existing Roadtrippers platform faced several critical issues that needed addressing:

- Power users lacked advanced functionality for planning detailed, multi-leg journeys
- Users couldn't effectively segment itineraries by day, making long trip planning cumbersome
- Search and filter tools were inefficient, limiting detailed trip planning capabilities
- New user onboarding created friction due to a difficult-to-navigate interface
- The color scheme was inconsistent and didn't meet accessibility standards
- The platform needed to maintain consistency across iOS, Android, and Web platforms
- The route line needed to remain on the right-hand side as part of brand identity
- Updates needed to be shipped in phases while maintaining functionality

## Solution

The solution was implemented through several key initiatives:

1. **Modular Trip Planner Development**
   - Created hundreds of prototypes focusing on critical UI details
   - Built interface to handle future features like daily trip segmentation
   - Designed robust, modular components for easy developer implementation

2. **Color System Overhaul**
   - Conducted comprehensive color audit across all platforms
   - Developed five distinct color ladders meeting accessibility standards
   - Ensured 4.5:1 contrast ratio between lightest and darkest tones
   - Created semantic and intentional color system foundation for dark mode

3. **Cross-Platform Consistency**
   - Standardized UI components across iOS, Android, and Web
   - Implemented consistent typography while maintaining platform-specific requirements
   - Developed flexible baseline grid system for cross-platform compatibility

## Impact

The redesign delivered significant improvements to the Roadtrippers platform:

1. **Technical Achievements**
   - Successfully implemented an accessible color system meeting WCAG guidelines
   - Created modular components that simplified feature integration
   - Established cross-platform typography system maintaining baseline grid consistency

2. **User Experience Improvements**
   - Enhanced trip planning flexibility for power users
   - 20% increase in multi-leg trip planning
   - 30% increase in the number of trips planned by power users
   - Improved search and filter functionality
   - Maintained platform consistency across all devices

3. **Future-Proofing**
   - Set foundation for future dark mode implementation
   - Established groundwork for the Bonfire Design System
   - Created scalable architecture for future feature additions

The project successfully positioned Roadtrippers as a more reliable and intuitive "copilot" for travelers while establishing a strong foundation for future platform enhancements.
