## Overview

ClearSpend is a specialized spend control and expense management platform designed for small businesses. The project evolved from concept to full launch between 2021-2022, with initial proof of concept completed by Christmas 2021 and official launch in February 2022. As the lead designer, I worked closely with multiple teams including marketing, branding, mobile product, and leadership while establishing a comprehensive design system.

## Challenge

The primary challenges included:

- Starting with only 10% of existing product materials (some old wireframes, layout attempts, and vision documents)
- Aggressive timeline requirements (5 months to soft launch, 3 months to hard launch)
- Need to create a system that required minimal human intervention
- Complex data structure requirements for budget management
- Accessibility issues with brand colors
- Balancing information density with usability
- Creating scalable solutions for future multi-account functionality

## Solution

The solution was implemented through several key components:

1. **Dashboard Design**

- Created a 10,000ft view for managers and employees
- Implemented intuitive data visualization
- Balanced screen width with information density
- Developed clear visual hierarchy through careful use of spacing and grouping

1. **Allocations Management**

- Implemented a parent-child budget structure
- Set strategic limitations (e.g., 5-level depth maximum)
- Created clear visual separation using color, borders, and rounded corners

1. **Side Panel Pattern**

- Developed a consistent UI pattern for data editing across the platform
- Created a framework for easy design and prototyping of future panels
- Consolidated various data editing methods into a coherent system

1. **Multi-Account Design**

- Designed searchable client lists with pinned favorites
- Implemented layered information architecture
- Created specialized dashboards for different user types (e.g., accountants vs. business managers)

## Impact

The project delivered several significant outcomes:

- Complete product transformation from concept to launch in 8 months
- Creation of a comprehensive design system that enabled future scaling
- Development of developer-ready documentation
- Establishment of consistent UI patterns across the product
- Successful implementation of key user flows:

  - Owner onboarding

  - Money allocation for employees

  - Account card request and approval

  - Expense management

  - Report generation

- Creation of a flexible framework that supported both immediate needs and future expansion
