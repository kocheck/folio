## Overview

Roadpass Digital operated five distinct products, each built on different technological foundations including React, React Native, WordPress, and Ruby on Rails. To address the challenges arising from this diversity, a cross-functional team developed "Bonfire," a unified design system aimed at supporting all platforms, streamlining processes, and fostering consistency across all products.

## Challenge

The company faced several critical issues:
- Individual product teams were reinventing solutions for identical problems
- Inconsistent user experience across platforms confused users
- Resource strain due to redundant efforts
- Difficult onboarding process for new team members
- Lack of shared design language hindering collaboration
- Multiple tech stacks requiring different implementation approaches
- Absence of engineering leadership support
- Limited resources and tight deadlines

## Solution

The team developed Bonfire as a comprehensive design system with the following key components:
- Design tokens for centralized control of colors, typography, and spacing
- Bonfire Tailwind Plugin for quick implementation and cross-brand theming
- Library of 14 atomized components in Figma and Storybook
- Support for multiple tech stacks (React, React Native, vanilla HTML/CSS/JS)
- Open contribution model for company-wide participation
- Detailed documentation in Storybook and Figma libraries
- Accessibility-first approach in design implementation

## Impact

The implementation of Bonfire delivered significant measurable results:
1. Efficiency Improvements:
   - 80% reduction in feature completion time per platform
   - Multi-platform support for 5+ platforms simultaneously
   - Reduced QA resource requirements

2. Adoption and Standardization:
   - 64% increase in design system adoption
   - Established as company standard with continued use

3. Accessibility Enhancements:
   - Reduced accessibility issues from 500,000+ to just hundreds

4. Financial Benefits:
   - Annual savings of $143,000
   - Design Team Savings: $54,600
   - Engineering Team Savings: $88,400

5. Collaboration Benefits:
   - Improved speed and efficiency reported by both design and development teams
   - Enhanced cross-team collaboration
   - Streamlined design and development processes
