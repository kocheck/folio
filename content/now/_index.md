# ðŸŒ± Whats Growing

Welcome to my living, breathing corner of the internet! This is my "Now" page meets digital garden - a constantly evolving space where I'm actively tending to ideas, projects, and learnings in real-time.

Think of this less as a polished blog and more like peeking over my shoulder as I explore, experiment, and grow. Here you'll find my current obsessions, half-baked thoughts, and works-in-progress. Some ideas are seedlings, others are in full bloom, and a few might be lovely weeds I've decided to keep.

Feel free to wander through my garden - use the search below to explore specific topics, or simply meander through the latest updates. Unlike a traditional blog, entries here may evolve and grow as I learn more.
