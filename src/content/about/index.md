## Welcome to my corner of the internet ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Product Designer who turns complex challenges into elegant solutions. Currently, I'm crafting B2B and B2C experiences at <a href="https://www.breakline.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BreakLine</a>, with systematic thinking and creative problem-solving.

### What drives me

I believe in the power of thoughtful design to transform ideas into successful products. My approach combines strategic thinking with pixel-perfect execution, especially when working with startups and scaling teams.

### Let's connect

I'm always up for a thoughtful conversation about design, systems thinking, or even diving into discussions about sci-fi von Neumann probes! [Grab a virtual coffee with me?](mailto:hello+website@kylekochanek.com?subject=Virtual%20Coffee%20Chat&body=Hi%20Kyle!)
